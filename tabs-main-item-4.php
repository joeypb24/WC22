						There are two ways to attack this. Are you the conservative type who is willing to take small wins as long as the losses are not dire? Or are you the kind who risks for the big payout?
					</p>
					<p class="review-text">
						Regardless which side you are, just be smart about it. Those betting tickets that became viral because they hit paydirt due to some odd parlay that actualized? They were not large wagers to begin with.
					</p>
					<p class="review-text">
						That is money you are willing to “lose”.

						This is for those who like to play it safe. These are almost guaranteed wins.

					<p class="review-text">
						For an added tip, do not go outside of the top ten when picking the tournament champion. Leicester City winning the English Premier League is just that – a fluke. Same thing with the most prestigious football tournament in the world.

						Are we contradicting ourselves? Not really.

					<p class="review-text">
						In a short competition such as this, upsets happen. Unlike the UEFA Champions League that feature home-and-away legs, there are no second chances here.
					</p>
					<p class="review-text">
						No one expected South Korea to reach the semifinal round of the tourney they hosted 20 years ago, but they did. Fast forward to 2018, everybody was shocked when then defending champion Germany was eliminated by, yes, South Korea.

						This might be brief, but we hope you took something out of it. Good luck!
